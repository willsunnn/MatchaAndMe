# Matcha & Me

## The overall goals of our project is to:
1. Accurately measure important values regarding plant growth using sensors and present it to the user via a mobile app or web application 
2. Analyze these values in order to make reasonable suggestions for maintaining or improving plant growth
3. Control actuators that can directly influence plant growth, such as water valves and light sources
